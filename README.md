# heart-diseases
Brief Description of the Project (Purpose, Dataset, Your Work)

Purpose:
The aim of this project was to build a machine learning model that can help predict the risk of heart disease in individuals using their medical data. The idea was to apply what I’ve learned in Python and machine learning to solve a real-world health-related problem and make it accessible through a simple web interface.

Dataset:
I used the Heart Disease dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It includes several health parameters like age, gender, chest pain type, cholesterol level, blood pressure, and more — all of which are useful indicators for predicting heart disease.

My Work:
I started by loading the dataset and cleaning the data using Python libraries like Pandas and NumPy. I took care of missing values, encoded categorical features, and normalized the data to prepare it for modeling. Then, I explored the data using visualizations (like heatmaps and bar charts) to understand patterns and correlations.

After preprocessing, I built different machine learning models such as Logistic Regression and Random Forest using Scikit-learn. I evaluated their performance and selected the one with the best accuracy. Finally, I developed a simple user interface using Streamlit so that users can input their own values and get instant predictions from the model.
